# Graphical Representaion of Irrational States (GRIS)

## Overview
GRIS is a research project for my undergraduate honor's thesis at the School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences at the University of Texas of Dallas. The goals of this project is to:

1. Create concept graphs from Reddit posts of people with psychotic disorders and people without psychotic disorders
2. Use a graph neural network to differentiate between the concept graphs of these two populations
3. Extract meaningful information from the neural networks to learn about the differences between these two populations
4. Determine if there are any differences in the concept graphs of these two populations
